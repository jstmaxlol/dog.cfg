##
**dog.cfg** is a simple, *header-only* library for managing your **custom config** files \\\\( ͡• ͜ʖ ͡• ) \
\
i would recommend adding `dog.h` to `/usr/include/` instead of manually inserting the absolute path everytime or copying the .h in every project dir


## how to pet?
to learn how to **pet** your `dog.h`, you can use either of the methods listed:
```
doxygen.nerd (
    1. install python (e.g. `pacman -S python`)
    2. clone the repo locally with `git clone https://github.com/jstmaxlol/dog.cfg/`
    3. `cd` into the `dog.cfg` you just cloned
    4. run the utility script `howto.sh`

    !5. if `howto.sh` doesn't work try `chmod +x howto.sh`
)
```
i recommend the `doxygen.nerd()` method for the ones who **benefit** more from **reading documentation**
```
puppy.tester ( 
    1. clone the repo locally with `git clone https:/github.com/jstmaxlol/dog.cfg/`
    2. read the `puppy.tester.cpp` file in your favourite IDE/text-editor
       there you'll find all the methods with simple comments explaining what method x is doing
)
```
i recommend the `puppy.tester()` method for the ones who **benefit** more from **seeing a program** that uses the library instead!
