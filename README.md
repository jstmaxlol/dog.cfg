##
dog.cfg is a simple, header-only library for managing your custom config files ( ͡• ͜ʖ ͡• ) \
would recommend using on linux and adding to `/usr/include/` instead of manually inserting the absolute path everytime or copying the .h in every project dir
##
any help with actually doing something in this readme would be helpful and appreciated lol \
for now enjoy the dog.cfg banner i guess (i forgor the '.' in the banner)
